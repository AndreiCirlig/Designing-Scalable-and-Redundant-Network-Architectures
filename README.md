# Designing-Scalable-and-Redundant-Network-Architectures
As part of my Network Protocols and Architectures coursework, I designed and implemented a scalable, redundant LAN & WAN network architecture for a supermarket chain's main offices. This project involved network design, hardware selection, and scalability planning while ensuring 100% redundancy and failover protection.
